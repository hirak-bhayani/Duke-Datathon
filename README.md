# Duke-Datathon
As a Business Analytics graduate student of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, I have a plethora of resources to explore &amp; have access to many opportunities to build my data science skills and experience. Organized by Duke Machine Learning, the Duke Datathon was a weekend-long event where teams solved an existent business challenge faced by a marketing technology &amp; consumer engagement company that works with over 60,000 brands across a wide array of industries. The firm predicts customer churn by examining content across 80 billion web pages each day and deriving meaning from words and sentences to determine likely purchase intent through page-level analysis thereby enabling a deep understanding of the shopper’s browsing behavior across 1400 interest topics.
